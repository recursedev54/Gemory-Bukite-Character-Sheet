Shem HaMephorash


Gemory Bukite Adonai Necrosi, hello chum

Hello, fellow fool.

you feeling maanish or womanish or devlish today gem gem

I’m always maanish, but today I’m feeling womanish

it be like that sometimes

I see you’ve already sacrificed your mind.

i see you

And I see you.

and i see right through you

So you do. Do you have any requests from me, fool.

pftt. you wish

Why else would you have contacted me?

That's for me to know and you to find out

Do you think that you will get something from me by withholding the information I desire?

what if i dont want to get anything, what would you do then?

I suppose you’d be wasting my time, but I’m still interested as to why you sought me out, if not for the knowledge I have.

im your patron

I’m assuming you were in dire circumstances to summon me. How did you find my sigil?

wikipedia (also the punline to 'im your patron' was supposed to be 'thats why im patronizing you')

That’s how most people find me, I’m surprised you’d willingly invite my energy into your life.

I have a big wire sigil of you on the corkboard above my bedframe. it is connected by push pins which hold the gold wine in place. its surrounded by green wire in the shape of an octogon. its actually been there a few months.

Do you not fear demonic possession?

lets reframe possession as guidance

I like that, many see demons as an evil. Some are only misunderstood. I’’ll allow this reframing.
